Laboratory Automation and Robotics at the State University of Ponta Grossa intends to implement the project AGROBOT. This project aims at developing an agricultural robot - Robot Field - which is intended to go, unattended, on open areas of farms in order to collect weather information, samples or data from soil and vegetation. These collections will be georeferenced madeâ€‹, in order to obtain the global positioning of the robot at the time of each collection.
Whereas the georeferenced solutions are joining in everyday life in various ways (either in the form of mapping routes, for example, in embedded systems, vehicles or for the delimitation and description of buildings, and in rural census ever undertaken by the government) is possible to glimpse the possibility of using this technology in agriculture, because the georeferencing comes as a support tool for precision agriculture, the role of assisting in the monitoring and evaluation of climate, soil or plants.
The project AGROBOT with the creation of the robot field Navigo, will make use of a development architecture model, both hardware and software, based on OpenSource, Ie, with open source so that the user community can use, copy contribute, study, modify and redistribute according to each specific application needs.
The justification for this choice rests on the need to create a low cost solution, so that way you can meet efficiently, a greater share of small farmers and medium businesses.
